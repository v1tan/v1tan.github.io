A simple but efficient website. I like the overall design and navigation. It is easy to see the 
flow of the website and to navigate to other lists. However, I would like to see more information 
about each entry on the lists. I also don't like that the content seems to be populated by the comments,
which means initially there is very little information about why each entry deserves a spot on the list.
